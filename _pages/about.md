I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student from [Department of Automation](https://automation.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/), China. My research interests focus on developing efficient machine-learning algorithms for large-scale datasets and architectures, where I strike a balance between theoretical understanding and practical application. Additionally, I am interested in Generative models and Robotics. What I want to achieve is applying Artificial Intelligence to the real world which will definitely change and improve our daily lives.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xiaolin Huang](http://www.pami.sjtu.edu.cn/xiaolin) of Shanghai Jiao Tong University Institute of Image Processing and Pattern Recognition from Department of Automation, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

You can find my CV here: [Jinghao Zheng's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/CV_zjh_1016.pdf).

Research Experience
======
* July 2024 -- Present: Research Assistant
  * Project Name: Fewer Generated Images for Better Augmentation
    * Leveraged the GLIDE, a text-to-image model, with real guidance strategies to diversify the training datasets.
    * Conducted experiments on multiple datasets using upsampling and Diffusion-based data augmentation techniques.
    * Improved the classification accuracy by 1\% than that without augmentation and training efficiency by 70\% than 2x scale Diffusion-based data augmentation using selectively incorporating generated data.
  * Advisor: Baharan Mirzasoleiman, Assistant Professor, Computer Science Department, UCLA
 
* Mar. 2024 -- June 2024: Co-author
  * Project Name: Unified Gradient-Based Machine Unlearning (MU) with Remain Geometry Enhancement
    * Proposed using KL divergence on the remaining output distribution, instead of Euclidean distance in vanilla methods, as the manifold metric to prevent deviations in the model output on the remaining set, improving MU performance.
    * Conducted experiments and parameter tuning to compare the performance of our algorithm with other MU methods in image classification and generation across various datasets and models of different architectures.
    * Improved the averaging disparity by 1.8\% on average in random subset forgetting on CIFAR-10 in image classification and the FID by 80 on average in class-wish forgetting on ImageNet in image generation.
  * Advisor: Xiaolin Huang, Professor, Vice Dean, Department of Automation, SJTU
